## Built With

[Python 3](https://www.python.org)

Other required tools: [tar](https://www.unix.com/man-page/linux/1/tar/), [zip](https://www.unix.com/man-page/linux/1/gzip/).

## Getting Started

### Running Tests

## Deployment

### Local
A local Docker container that mounts the test data can be built and executed using:

```
docker build . -t pyramid-prepare-data
docker run -v "$(pwd)/data:/data" pyramid-prepare-data
```

Note that output from the container, placed in the `./data` subdirectory, will have `root` ownership as a result of the way in which Docker's access permissions work.

### Production
#### DAFNI upload
The model is containerised using Docker, and the image is _tar_'ed and _zip_'ed for uploading to DAFNI. Use the following commands in a *nix shell to accomplish this.

```
docker build . -t pyramid-prepare-data
docker save -o pyramid-read-external-dummy.tar pyramid-prepare-data:latest
gzip pyramid-prepare-data.tar
```

The `pyramid-prepare-data.tar.gz` Docker image and accompanying DAFNI model definintion file (`model-definition.yml`) can be uploaded as a new model using the "Add model" facility at [https://facility.secure.dafni.rl.ac.uk/models/](https://facility.secure.dafni.rl.ac.uk/models/).

## Usage
The deployed model can be run in a DAFNI workflow. See the [DAFNI workflow documentation](https://docs.secure.dafni.rl.ac.uk/docs/how-to/how-to-create-a-workflow) for details.
